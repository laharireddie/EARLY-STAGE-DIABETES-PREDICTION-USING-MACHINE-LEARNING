This project focuses on predicting early-stage diabetes in individuals using two popular machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The goal is to develop a system that can classify individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on various medical attributes.
Machine Learning Models
1.LOGISTIC REGRESSION:
A linear model used to estimate the probability of an individual having diabetes.
Ideal for datasets where the relationship between the features and the target variable is linear.
Provides interpretability and insight into the importance of each feature.
2.RANDOM FOREST:
An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve accuracy and control overfitting.
Captures non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Generally provides better accuracy compared to Logistic Regression, especially when working with complex datasets.
